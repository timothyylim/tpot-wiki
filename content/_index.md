# Welcome, traveller

This is a non-definitive, highly biased, and completely organic wiki that aims to scope out the tpot world.

## What is TPOT?

![a tweet by @VividVoid_ that reads: No one knows what the hell we're doing here in TPOT. The universe brought us together for its own inscrutable reasons. The only criteria for inclusion is that you resonate with us and what we're creating. You belong here. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.](/images/VividVoid_TPOT.png) â€” [@VividVoid_](https://x.com/VividVoid_/status/1671200246146248711)

tpot stands for 'this part of Twitter' and that's about the last that can definitively be said about it. Asking someone what TPOT is is like asking them to describe a rainbow, how they see it will never be how you see it. Our feeds on Twitter are just thin slits from which we are all viewing and reaching into this crazy show that is ultimately a personal hallucination. But from this hallucination, many wonderful things have sprung, and it is the goal of this site to catalogue and describe them.
